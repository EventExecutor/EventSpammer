# EventSpammer V 1.0

**Installation**:

1. Install **```python 3.13.1```** using this link: **https://www.python.org/downloads/**
2. In the installer you have to check the box **```"Add to path"```** otherwise it doesn't work
3. Once python installed, open the file **```installer.bat```**
4. Wait until installation is complete
5. Once complete, open the **```start-config.bat```**
6. In the start-config.bat you have to follow the instructions that the configGen asks you for
7. I recomend you to say **```n```** when it ask you **```"Do you want to use a SOCKS proxy?"```**, because you don't have a proxy file or a single proxy.
8. Once you have set up the webhook and the message to be spammed, you need to start the **```start.bat```**
9. **Enjoy your spam!**

*Sorry for the obfuscation, but i dont want to drop the source code, for now.*
